# Auto Etch A Sketch
These are the 3D files and code created for Element14 Presents Episode 372: Raspberry Pi Auto Etch A Sketch.

You can get an idea of how everything was assembled by looking at the final_assembly step file, the STLs are orientated in the way I printed them, some files need supports but most of them should print ok without. 

The program I used to create/send g-code can be found here: https://github.com/svenhb/GRBL-Plotter

The Arduino CNC Shield I used is this one: https://blog.protoneer.co.nz/arduino-cnc-shield/
